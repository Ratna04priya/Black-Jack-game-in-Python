## Casino Black Jack game : Coded in Python 

**Blackjack**, *also known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between usually several players and a dealer, where each player in turn competes against the dealer, but players do not play against each other*. It is played with one or more decks of 52 cards, and is the most widely played casino banking game in the world. *The objective of the game is to beat the dealer* in one of the following ways: 
1. >Get 21 points on the player's first two cards (called a "blackjack" or "natural"), without a dealer blackjack

2. >Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21 .... or....

3. >Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.

### Rules :
1. Blackjack may be played with one to eight decks of 52-card decks.
2. Aces may be counted as 1 or 11 points, 2 to 9 according to pip value, and tens and face cards count as ten points. 
3. The value of a hand is the sum of the point values of the individual cards. Except, a "blackjack" is the highest hand,     consisting of an ace and any 10-point card, and it outranks all other 21-point hands. 
4. After the players have bet, the dealer will give two cards to each player and two cards to himself. One of the dealer cards is dealt face up. The facedown card is called the "hole card." 
5. If the dealer has a ten or an ace showing (after offering insurance with an ace showing), then he will peek at his facedown card to see if he has a blackjack. If he does, then he will turn it over immediately.
6. After player has had his turn, the dealer will turn over his hole card. If the dealer has 16 or less, then he will draw another card. A special situation is when the dealer has an ace and any number of cards totaling six points (known as a "soft 17"). At some tables, the dealer will also hit a soft 17. 
7. If the dealer goes over 21 points, then any player who didn't already bust will win. 
8. If the dealer does not bust, then the higher point total between the player and dealer will win. 

### Choice the Player has :
1. >Stand: Player stands pat with his cards. 
2. >Hit: Player draws another card (and more if he wishes). If this card causes the player's total points to exceed 21 (known as "breaking" or "busting") then he loses.
